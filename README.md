# Programming 3 Course Summary

## Overview

This document summarizes the key topics covered in the Programming 3 course. The course focuses on advanced concepts in Java development, database integration, and web services, equipping students with the skills necessary to build robust and scalable enterprise applications. 

## Topics Covered

- **Database Management**: Learn to integrate relational databases into Java applications using SQL and Java Persistence API (JPA). Understand database schemas, entity relationships, and CRUD operations.

- **Java Enterprise Edition (Java EE)**: Explore the components of Java EE for enterprise-level applications, including Servlets, JSPs, and EJBs. Learn how to create scalable and secure applications using enterprise patterns.

- **HTTP Protocols**: Gain an in-depth understanding of HTTPS, including its structure, methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE), and secure communication principles.

- **Java Web Services**:
  - **RESTful Services**: Develop REST APIs using JAX-RS, focusing on stateless architecture and JSON/XML data interchange.
  - **SOAP Services**: Learn to create and consume SOAP-based web services using JAX-WS and understand WSDL and SOAP envelopes.

- **Java Versions**: Review the evolution of Java, with a focus on features introduced in modern versions (e.g., Java 8 Streams, Java 9 modules, Java 17 LTS updates).

- **Web Development**: Integrate Java with front-end technologies, explore MVC architecture, and build interactive web applications.

## Technologies Used

The course emphasizes practical learning with the following technologies:

- **Java (Various Versions)**: Core and enterprise features of Java.
- **JPA**: For object-relational mapping and database interactions.
- **HTTP/HTTPS**: For secure communication protocols.
- **REST and SOAP APIs**: Development of web services.
- **Maven**: Dependency management and project build tool.
- **GlassFish/Tomcat**: Java application servers.
- **Postman**: API testing and debugging tool.

## Learning Outcomes

By the end of the course, students will be able to:

1. Develop enterprise-level applications using Java EE.
2. Design and implement RESTful and SOAP web services.
3. Integrate and manage relational databases in Java applications.
4. Securely interact with web services using HTTPS protocols.
5. Understand the features and improvements of different Java versions.
6. Apply modern development practices for scalable and maintainable code.
